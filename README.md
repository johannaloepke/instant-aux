# instant-aux

All of us have different tastes in music. Which is why when we
are inevitably in charge of the aux cord, whether at a party or 
during a road trip, pleasing everyone can be difficult.

With Instant Aux, just select genres or artists that the group 
enjoys and a custom playlist of Spotify songs will instantly be
generated. Have fun jamming out!
